# NC Games

NC Games is a website where users can read, comment and vote on reviews based on popular board games. This frontend project comes as part of the full stack solo project we are challenged with on the Northcoders bootcamp. The UI is built using React and I took a mobile first approach when it came to styling with CSS. It is still a work in progress but feel free to have a look at where I am so far using the link below!
